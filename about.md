## the Academy of (almost) Anything
---
With the increasing availability and ease of use of digital tools and systems, both in the world of fabrication, biology and design, the possibility to solve problems locally is becoming greater every day. But it is often overlooked that the tools and means to build objects destined for everyday use, or to safely use synthetic biology to locally produce energy or medicine, is not at all easy or trivial.

## Distributed learning in the Fab Lab Network
---
**The Academany is a new global educational structure offering high level education all over the globe**, at connected sites offering the same infrastructure to all students. Note we do not offer online courses, but that all our classes are a combination of online live lectures and locally available tools, machines and consumables as well as local instructors and gurus.

The Fab Lab Network provides a local learning spaces near your location, but connected to a distributed learning platform to share and learn from others. Meet many students like you in a hands-on learning programs that goes from digital fabrication to textiles. **The future of learning is distributed**.

## How to learn almost anything
---
A range of topics are covered by this distributed learning, all related to the learning of new methods, technics, approaches and investigation in several scopes related with all kind of subjects. And **each year the number of distributed learning topics are increasing**, giving you the unique opportinity to unleash your skill in topics never covered in formal education.
Lectures and classes are spreaded through the network in videconferences, and your main work is developed in your local Fab Lab, mentored by a local instructor.

Current classes are the Fab Academany - **How to Make (almost) Anything**, and the Bio Academy - **How to Grow (almost) Anything**.

In September 2017 a new class will be added called **Fabricademy**, about the mix of textiles, biology and digital fabrication.

Fab Academy is based on the MIT class How to Make (Almost) Anything as developed by Professor Neil Gershenfeld from the MIT - Bio Academy is directed by professor George Church from Harvard.
